// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// 1. Planning
// 2. Analysis of Requirements
// 3. Design
// 4. Implementation
// 5. Testing & Integration
// 6. Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added."

const analysisOfRequirements = "In this next step, developers acquire the knowledge needed in order to build the correct product that will correctly implement that which was planned in the first step."

const design = "The developers begin building the overall form and function of the project(s) that will then be available to be built out with further implementation. In many cases this involves activities such as building models and storyboards."

const implementation = "In this step, the developers write the code, problem solve, and work as a team to create logic function that will allow the application(s) to work properly and as intended."

const testingAndIntegration = "Developers use pre-planned scenarios to simulate load testing on the application(s) and respond to issues accordingly, establishing quality assurance to address and track defects. Software that is ready for deployment is then sent to production."

const maintain = "Measurements and management of the project are ongoing in order to continue to uphold quality and delivery over the application lifecycle."
